# Split Files for MGS2
These folders contain LSS format split files for each category that you can open (or drag into) LiveSplit.

## TL;DR
* `(!)` at the start of the filename indicates the recommended routes for each category.
* If doing a *Conveyor* route, you'll likely want the (more difficult, but faster) **A-C variant**.
* Otherwise, on a Plant category...
  * On *Very Easy, Easy and Normal*, you're most likely to use the **Clockwise** route.
  * On *Hard, Extreme and European Extreme*, you're most likely to use the **Anticlockwise** route.
* If you want to use a *Subsplits* split file, make sure you're also using a *Subsplits* component (not the regular *Splits* component) in your LS layout.

## Splits vs Subsplits
* Dy default, your LiveSplit layout will use a *Splits* component, which puts all of your splits into one simple list.
  * For this component, use the split files provided in the folders that end with **Splits**.
* If you instead put a *Subsplits* component into your layout, the split file can be organised into sections (e.g. from the start of the game to beating Olga).
  * The Subsplits component has lots of options to customise how sections appear. For some ideas, see [the Layout Guide](/LayoutGuide.md).
  * For this component, use the split files provided in the folders that end with **Subsplits**.
* Do *not* use *Subsplits* split files with a *Splits* component! They have extra formatting that will make your splits look bad.

## Bomb Disposal Routes
There are four main routes during the *Bomb Disposal* section (between finding Stillman and heading to the last bomb in the Deep Sea Dock):
* **Clockwise** starts by heading towards Strut D and travelling clockwise.
  * This is the fastest regular route, but starts with the hardest Struts, so is best suited to difficulties that give you the M9 early.
  * Clockwise is standard on **Very Easy**, **Easy** and **Normal**.
* **Anticlockwise** starts by heading towards Strut B and travelling anticlockwise.
  * This route is slower on paper, but allows you to get the M9 in Strut F before having to deal with Struts E and D.
  * Anticlockwise is standard on **Hard**, **Extreme** and **European Extreme**.
* In the *Conveyor* routes, you start anticlockwise and pick up cardboard boxes to use in Strut E (together with a glitch to speed up the process).
  * The **A-C variant** is the faster route, which picks up Box 1 in Strut A and travels to Strut C.
  * The **F-B variant** is slower but easier. It picks up Box 2 in Strut F and travels to Strut B.

## Route Differences by Difficulty
* In Aft Deck, on difficulties up to *Normal*, you can take the right exit to Deck B. On *Hard* and up, you must take the longer route via Deck A.
* After Fatman, on *Very Easy*, you do not need to go to Strut F for the AK, and can go directly to Shell 1 Core.
* In Bomb Disposal, on *Hard* and up, you must also defuse the bomb on Strut A Roof.
